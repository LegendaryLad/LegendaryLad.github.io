First in Plight: 1-64 

The original 64 plights were crafted and held in a deep space starting December
 of 2022. They were made available for sale. A portion of the early plights were
 reclaimed and are held in BOX and ALSO BOX, denoted below as "Boxed."
 The uncollected, remain (or not) in deep space and are entered as such.

1. JAY OF THE MIDNIGHT SUNSET
The beautiful end will echo a beautiful beginning.

2. BOXED
This one begs to be stolen. If you have the means, please do so. It is
 currently on my bookshelf next to Anne Garreta's In Concrete.

17. RITA JIMENEZ
It is expected, that if Rita were given the chance, she would have given
 the title "of Iritadescent." Alas, it is only held here, in the layered
 textures of the archival.

18. REMY HARRIS
See me after class.

19. ADRIANA POLITIS

26. PRINCESS PEGGY

27. NANO OF SPORT
Plighted as recompensation for playing the squire during the act of Ce-
 mentus Set. The pour pour lad knew not what trials he committed
 to, but remains a true co-creator of the first of the Works. He was an
 incredible Sport.

28. SAMIR OF EMPATHY

29. BRYAN OF EASY, BREEZY, BEAUTIFUL
On the Taurus moon of 2023, plights no. 29, 52, 58, 60, and 63 were
 brought into the world for their plighting. Upon entry into the cage of
 Pet Shop, an agent of Janus, a keeper of thresholds, an old friend was
 found.

 Dante holds the distinction of the first recognized. The profane purchase
 of the plight was witnessed and having been so, was graced with the
 knowledge of the weight to bear. So entered all into the inferno.
"
"45.","Natalie of Racoon Whispher
 Adjacent artist during Cementus Set. She proffered outdoor tape which,
 in retrospect, would have been a great boon. Gift givers must learn to
 accept them as well.

 Plight no. 52 was the first to consume its own numeration, thus, pun-
 fortunately, it was dubbed the "Weekest." Raffzilla on the other hand is
 perhaps the strongest.

Veeler points to a lone form amongst the minnows, cloud headed and
 with a kind face. I plight them and recieve their title before a hasty
 return to the magical miasma I had been at brew before. So burdened,
 the storm kept the cube in their right hand for the entire show. I left
 the building as the pigs filed in.
As the clock struck 1h26 on 25 Merde 150, mere hours after the plight-
 ing, I recieved an email from Hex House, subject line "Advice accepted."
 The body of the email held a 2.2 MB IMG 9564.jpeg file revealing an
 unknown character at hammer to chisel upon what must be assumed to
 be no. 352.
Cybersewing bring to me another sight of the plight, as @charstiles
 emits a video of @yoyo.munk taking the chisel to cement, followed by
 @blackchainbody holding the un-fortunate plight alight. Burn on.
